      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;peoples-genomes-differ&#34;&gt;People&amp;rsquo;s Genomes Differ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person&amp;rsquo;s genome is the complete set of DNA packed in chromosomes that is found in all the cells in their body.
When looking at the genome, people are far more similar than they are different. On average any two
people&amp;rsquo;s genomes are ~99.6% identical and thus only about ~0.4% of the DNA is differs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in DNA between individuals or between populations is called genetic variation.
Changes in DNA sequence of a gene can alter its activity or the function of a resulting protein.
This effect may introduce different traits in the individual such as hair color or blood type.
The set of genomic variants an individual carries, among other factors such as diet and environment,
contributes to their uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-reference-genome&#34;&gt;What is a reference genome?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human reference genome, reference assembly, is a sequence of nucleotides representing genes
and non-coding regions of the genome.
It is made up from a combination multiple individual&amp;rsquo;s DNA and hence not representing a
genome of any single human but an average of all humans in the world. However,
it is difficult to get proper representation of all humans due to the bias in the
selection of participants for the genome sequencing and the great variantion in some parts
of the genome between populations.
The first version was released in 2000 and there have been
multiple improvements and versions after that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
