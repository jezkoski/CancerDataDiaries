## People's Genomes Differ

Person's genome is the complete set of DNA packed in chromosomes that is found in all the cells in their body.
When looking at the genome, people are far more similar than they are different. On average any two
people's genomes are ~99.6% identical and thus only about ~0.4% of the DNA is differs.

The difference in DNA between individuals or between populations is called genetic variation. 
Changes in DNA sequence of a gene can alter its activity or the function of a resulting protein.
This effect may introduce different traits in the individual such as hair color or blood type. 
The set of genomic variants an individual carries, among other factors such as diet and environment,
contributes to their uniqueness. 

There are multiple types of genomic variants that vary in their size and their prevalence in the population.
The smallest genomic variants are single-nucleotide variants, which is a change in a single nucleotide (A,T,C,G).
Genomic variants may also cover multiple nucleotides such as deletions or insertions.

When talking about genomic variants, they are often refered as germline or somatic. What does this means?


## Germline Variants vs. Somatic Mutations

Genomic variants can be germline variants or somatic mutations depending whether they are inherited or acquired.

Germline variant is a change that has already happened in the germline, ie. the variant is inherited from both or one of the parents and is present in the egg or the sperm. 
Because the variant is inherited from the parents, it will be present in all the cells of the body (Figure 1, left side).


Somatic mutations are acquired changes in other cell types than germ cells. These can be acquired already at embryo stage but also later in age. 
As person ages they accumulate somatic mutations and this may for example lead to cancer. 
Mutations are only present in the affected cells and their daughter cells after division but are not present in any other cells of the body and cannot be inherited by the offspring (Figure 1, right side).
