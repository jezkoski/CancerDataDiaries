## People's Genomes Differ

Person's genome is the complete set of DNA packed in chromosomes that is found in all the cells in their body.
When looking at the genome, people are far more similar than they are different. On average any two
people's genomes are ~99.6% identical and thus only about ~0.4% of the DNA is differs.

The difference in DNA between individuals or between populations is called genetic variation. 
Changes in DNA sequence of a gene can alter its activity or the function of a resulting protein.
This effect may introduce different traits in the individual such as hair color or blood type. 
The set of genomic variants an individual carries, among other factors such as diet and environment,
contributes to their uniqueness. 

There are multiple types of genomic variants that vary in their size and their prevalence in the population.
The smallest genomic variants are single-nucleotide variants, which is a change in a single nucleotide (A,T,C,G).
Genomic variants may also cover multiple nucleotides such as deletions or insertions.

When talking about genomic variants, they are often refered as germline or somatic. What does this mean?


## Germline Variants vs. Somatic Mutations

Genomic variants can be germline variants or somatic mutations depending whether they are inherited or acquired.

Germline variant is a change that has already happened in the germline, ie. the variant is inherited from 
both or one of the parents and is present in the egg or the sperm. 
Because the variant is inherited from the parents, it will be present in all the cells of the body 
(Figure 1, left side).
These variants can also be passed on to the offspring.


Somatic mutations are acquired changes in other cell types than germ cells. These can be acquired already 
at embryo stage but also later in age. As person ages they accumulate somatic mutations and this may for 
example lead to cancer, when the person acquires pathogenic mutations. Mutations are only present in the 
affected cells and their daughter cells after division but are not present in any other cells of the body
 and cannot be inherited by the offspring (Figure 1, right side).

## The Effects of Germline Variants and Somatic Mutations

Not all the variants and mutations have phenotype causing effect. Some of the changes can be synonymous, 
meanining that for example a change in the single nucleotide does not lead to a change of amino acid. 
In addition, the mutations are generally random. The changes may be located  on regions other than genes,
 and even when located on a gene and leading to an amino acid change, there still may not be a major effect.


In what cases then do germline variant or somatic mutation case an effect? More specifically, a disease?


### Disease Causing Variants and Mutations

There are several factors that can be taken into consideration when estimating whether genetic change is
 disease causing or not. These are for example, variant type (single nucleotide change, frameshift,
 nonsense etc), affected gene, and the location on the gene. Let's look at examples related to cancers.

In cancer, if a somatic mutation is on a oncogene or tumor suppressor gene, there is a high
potential for them to lead to cancer. Oncogenes promote uncontrolled cell growth and division, which can lead 
to cancerous cells. Oncogenes often need only one mutation to activate it. 

Tumor suppressors work in an opposite manner to oncogenes: they slow down cell division or signal the cells to 
die at the right time. Tumor suppressors usually need two mutations (both of the alleles should be changed) 
for them to lose their function as a gatekeeper of cell division and death. More on the oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes, and how they function in cancer from Dakal et al [1]. 

Germline variants are far less common in cancers compared to somatic mutations. Cancers caused by germline
variants are called inherited or hereditary cancers. They often operate via the Knudson's Two Hit -hypothesis:
1) Person inherits variant on a one allele (of tumor suppressor gene). 2) The second allele is affected
by a somatic mutation. Inherited variants thus increase the risk/predispose to cancers. One of the maybe the 
most known example of hereditary cancers is the BRCA1- and BRCA2-gene associated breast and ovarian cancers [2]. 
Individuals who have inherited a variant in these genes have a higher risk of developing the cancer themselves
at some point of their life.
