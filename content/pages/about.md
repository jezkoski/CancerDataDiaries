I'm a PhD student in bioinformatics/genetics focusing on germline predisposition 
in hematological cancers and diseases.

I'm mainly using python and bash for my coding tasks and occassionally R. In my projects I'm working on
whole exome and genome sequencing data (somatic + germline), single cell RNAseq + ATACseq, 
and currently learning about metabolomics (UPLC-MS/MS) and proteomics (Olink) data. Lately, I'm heavily 
leaning on the single cell data side and highly interested in the interpretation and integration of 
multi-omics analyses. 

This blog acts as my online notebook and learning diary and I will be writing mainly about the 
topics I'm learning about during my research.
